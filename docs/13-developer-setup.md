How to run Anish1989 Business OS on your own computer (Windows, macOS or Linux).

## Option A: Docker (recommended)

You need **Docker Desktop** (on Windows, with the WSL 2 backend).

1. Copy the example settings file:
   ```powershell
   copy .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open `.env` and change:
   - `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` to a long random string
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to a password, and the same password inside `DATABASE_URL`
3. Start everything:
   ```powershell
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   The first start runs database migrations and creates the platform tenant.
4. Create a platform admin (Super Admin) in another terminal:
   ```powershell
   docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
5. Create a test business:
   ```powershell
   docker compose exec web python manage.py create_business --name "Gorkha Butchery" --slug gorkhabutchery --industry butchery
   ```
6. Create a login for that business (its users live in its own schema):
   ```powershell
   docker compose exec web python manage.py tenant_command createsuperuser --schema=gorkhabutchery
   ```
7. Open in the browser:
   - Platform admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/
   - Business admin: http://gorkhabutchery.localhost:8000/admin/
   - Health check: http://localhost:8000/health/

`*.localhost` addresses work in Chrome, Edge and Firefox without changing DNS.

## Option B: Python on your computer

You need Python 3.13, PostgreSQL 16 and Redis running locally.

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate          # macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

In `.env`, use `localhost` instead of `db` and `redis` in `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL`. Then:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate_schemas --shared
python manage.py bootstrap_platform
python manage.py runserver
```

## Running tests

```powershell
cd backend
python -m pytest
```

The tests need PostgreSQL and Redis (Docker: `docker compose up -d db redis`). They create three tenants in a temporary test database and check that:
- every business gets its own schema and users table
- data in one business is invisible to another
- a user of one business cannot log in to another business or the platform
- tenant admins cannot see the tenant registry, and tenants cannot be deleted from the admin
- each host name is routed to the right schema, and unknown hosts get 404
- the health endpoint works and does not leak internal details

GitHub Actions runs the same tests and a Docker build on every push to `main`.

## Useful commands

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Create a business | `python manage.py create_business --name "..." --slug ... --industry ...` |
| Run a command in one business's schema | `python manage.py tenant_command <command> --schema=<slug>` |
| Migrate all schemas | `python manage.py migrate_schemas` |
| Make migrations after model changes | `python manage.py makemigrations` |

Industries: `butchery`, `restaurant`, `fast_food`, `catering`, `events`, `retail`, `services`, `education_consultancy`, `e_learning`, `jobs`, `other`.

## Rules

- Never commit `.env` or any real keys.
- Every new app must be added to `SHARED_APPS` (platform data) or `TENANT_APPS` (business data) in `config/settings.py`. Business data always goes in `TENANT_APPS`.
- Every feature needs tests, including a tenant isolation test where data is involved.
